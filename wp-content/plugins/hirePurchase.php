	   			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">What is a Hire Purchase Agreement?</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
	   			<p>This is a contract where you rent the vehicle from Smart Loans for an agreed period of time e.g. 36 months in return for a set weekly/monthly payment.</p>
	   			<p>During the agreement, you can use the car but the finance company actually owns it. They are the owner, and you are the hirer. At the end of the agreement, the finance company passes ownership of the car back to you, provided you have made all the repayments.</p>
	   			<p>  Car Finance is arranged under a Hire Purchase contract with Smart Loans. Hire Purchase is a contract where you rent the vehicle from Smart Loans for an agreed period of time e.g. 36 months in return for a set weekly payment. During the agreement, you can use the car but the finance company (i.e. Smart Loans) actually owns it.</p>
	   			<p> Smart Loans is the owner, and you are the hirer. At the end of the agreement, the finance company (i.e. Smart Loans) automatically passes ownership of the car over to you, provided you have made all the payments.</p>

	   			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">How do I get my money?</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
       			<p>You can receive your money within 24 hours of all documents being fully completed. After you have signed the loan agreements and we have verified everything, we will make a fast-track payment direct to your bank account.</p>


	   			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">What happens if I fail to make the payments under the Hire Purchase agreement?</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
       			<p>Smart Loans will contact you to assist you in getting your weekly or monthly payments back up to date. However, if payments are not brought up to date, the car may be repossessed and sold to repay the debt/finance outstanding.</p>

	   			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">Hire Purchase agreement benefits:</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
	   			
	   				<ul>
	   				<li> Smart Loans provides finance to individuals when no other Bank or Finance House will do so;</li>
	   				<li>It enables customers locked out of the normal credit options to get back on the borrowing ladder, a 2nd chance and a fresh start;</li>
	   				 <li>It enables individuals to upgrade their car. While the weekly/monthly payments may be higher than a prime lender, this can be offset due to the lower running and maintenance costs associated with your new car;</li>
	   				<li>A Hire Purchase agreement with Smart Loans helps to repair an individualâ€™s credit history which will help facilitate them access cheaper credit in the future.</li>
	   				
	   			</ul><br>

	   			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">What about my Credit History?</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
       			<p>Smart Loans are not concerned about what happened with you financially in the past, but believe in giving people a second change and helping them get back on track.</p>
       			<p> We are solely focused on your current financial circumstances and ensuring you can afford any new loan as we only want to engage in socially responsible lending. In addition, as you repay this loan, this will help to also repair your own credit profile.</p>

       			<h2 style="font-size: 22px" class="subheader">What is a Contract for Sale?</h2>
       			<div id="underlineHeader" style="display: block !important; margin-bottom: 20px"></div>
       			<p>A Contract for Sale is a legal agreement entered into by the borrower and the finance company (i.e. Smart Loans) where the ownership of the car is transferred to Smart Loans.</p>
       			<p> This Contract for Sale technically means we become the legal owner of the vehicle until the loan is fully repaid. However, during this period you are able to freely use your vehicle as long as payments are made, which is covered under the Hire Purchase agreement.</p>
